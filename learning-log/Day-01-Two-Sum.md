# Day 1 – Two Sum

## What I Learned

- How nested loops generate pairs
- What range(start, stop) does
- How enumerate works
- How hashmap reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)

## Mistakes I Made

- Didn’t understand range properly
- Confused about i + 1

## Key Insight

Instead of finding two numbers,
for each number, calculate the complement.
